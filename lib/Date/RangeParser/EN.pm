=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Returns a new instance of Date::RangeParser::EN.

Takes an optional hash of parameters:

=over 4

=item * B<datetime_class>

By default, Date::RangeParser::EN returns two L<DateTime> objects representing the beginning and end of the range. If you use a subclass of DateTime (or another module that implements the DateTime API), you may pass the name of this class to use it instead.

At the very least, this given class must implement a C<new> method that accepts a hash of arguments, where the following keys will be set:

  year
  month
  day
  hour
  minute
  second

This gives you the freedom to set your time zones and such however you need to.

=item * B<now_callback>

By default, Date::RangeParser::EN uses DateTime->now to determine the current date/time for calculations. If you need to work with a different time (for instance, if you need to adjust for time zones), you may pass a callback (code reference) which returns a DateTime object.

=cut

sub new
{
    my ($class, %params) = @_;

    my $self = \%params;

    bless $self, $class;

    return $self;
}

=head2 parse_range

Accepts a string representing a plain-English date range, for instance:

=over 4

=item * today

=item * this week

=item * the past 2 months

=item * next Tuesday

=item * two weeks ago

=item * the next 3 hours

=item * the 3rd of next month

=item * the end of this month

=back

More formally, this will parse the following kinds of date strings:

  NUMBER : ordinary number (1)
  PERIOD : one of: hour, day, week, month, quarter, or year (or the plural of these)
  WEEKDAY : one of: Monday, Tuesday, Wedensday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday
  CARDINAL : a cardinal number (21st) or the word for that number (twenty-first) or end
  MONTH : a month name: January, Feburary, March, April, May, June, July August, 
          September, October, November, or Decmeber or any 3-letter abbreviation
  YEAR : a 4-digit year (2-digits will not work)
  RANGE : any date range that can be parsed by parse_range
  ELEMENT : any element of a date range that can be parsed by parse_range

  MONTH                             : the named month of the current year, 1st to last day

  RANGE to RANGE                    : the very start of the first range to the very end of the second
  Tuesday to Next Saturday

  RANGE thru RANGE                  : the very start of the first range to the very end of the second
  2 hours ago thru the next 6 hours

  RANGE through RANGE               : the very start of the first range to the very end of the second
  August through December

  RANGE - RANGE                     : the very start of the first range to the very end of the second
  9-1-2012 - 9-30-2012

  RANGE-RANGE                       : the very start of the first range to the very end of the second
  10/10-10/20                         (ranges must not contain hyphens, "-")

  since ELEMENT                     : the date specified in the ELEMENT to the end of the current day
  since last Sunday

Anything else is parsed by L<Date::Manip>. If Date::Manip is unable to parse the
date given either, then the dates returned will be undefined.

Also, when parsing:

=over

=item *

The word "the" will always be ignored and can appear anywhere.

=item *

Cardinal numbers may be spelled out as words, i.e. "September first" instead of
"September 1st".

=item * 

Any plural or singular period shown above can be used with the opposite.

=item *

All dates are parsed relative to the parser's notion of now. You can control
this by setting the C<now_callback> option on the constructor.

=back

Returns two L<DateTime> objects, reprensenting the beginning and end of the range.

=head1 TO DO

There's a lot more that this module could handle. A few items that come to mind:

=over 4

=item * 

More testing to make sure certain date configurations are handled, like start of
week.

=item *

Handle Unicode in places where such handling makes sense (like hyphen detection)

=item * 

Allow full words instead of digits ("two weeks ago" vs "2 weeks ago")

=item * 

Allow "between" for ranges ("between last February and this Friday") in addition
to "to/through" ranges

=item *

This module is US English-centric (hence the "EN") and might do some things
wrong for other variants of English and a generic C<Date::RangeParser> interface
could be made to allow for other languages to be parsed this way.

=item *

Depends on L<Date::Manip>. This may or may not be a good thing.
